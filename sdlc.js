/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which understanding of what is needed to convert the requirements into a possible product are documented. Project organizers and developers will typically gather, analyze and document the requirements."

const design = "This is the third step, in which a hands on model is created. The purpose of this step is to have a visual and hands-on idea of how the software will look and work."

const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which actual code is being written. Developers will begin and execute the coding process until the software is ready for integration."

const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which the software has been tested and accepted by the user. This phase may require debugging and continues until the system operates in accordance with the defined requirements."

const maintain = "This is the final step, in which the software is almost completed. The software is done and being used by the user. To maintain the software, developers will typically seek any improvements through debugging and tracking user compliance."
